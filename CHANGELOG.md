### 0.13.0

* Added ssl_cert, ssl_cert_type, ssl_key_password to support self-signed SSL cert file

### 0.12.1

* Ensure HTTP2 response headers/status lines are correctly handled

### 0.12.0

* Replace StringScanner in HeaderParser with StringIO, fix Webmock regression when the headers string would
  not have an empty CRLF-terminated line at the end - which would cause the parser to return a nil.
* Added `Session#dns_cache_timeout` as a config option for CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT

### 0.11.1

* Make sure StringScanner is available to HeaderParser.

### 0.11.0

* Added `Session#progress_callback` which accepts a callable object, which can be used to report session progress during request
  execution.
* Fixed parsing of response headers when multiple responses are involved (redirect chains and HTTP proxies)

### 0.10.0

* Added `Session#low_speed_time` and `Session#low_speed_limit`. When used, they will force libCURL to raise
  a timeout if a certain speed limit is not met performing the request. These can be used for better timeout
  handling. These are available in all libCURL versions. See https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME.html
  and https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT.html

### 0.9.1

* Added ssl_version options `TLSv1_1`, `TLSv1_2`, `TLSv1_3` for explicitly forcing the SSL version
    * requires the appropriate versions of libCURL and OpenSSL installed to support these new options
    * reference: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSLVERSION.html
* Added a new `:http_version` option with `HTTPv1_1` and `HTTPv2_0` values to explicitly set the HTTP version of HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.0
    * requires the appropriate versions of libCURL and OpenSSL installed to support these new options
    * reference: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION.html
* Updates the gem release procedure for more convenience, using the updated Rubygems.org tasks
* Update a few minor dependencies and documentation to be Ruby 2.4.1-compatible, add 2.4.1. to Travis CI matrix
* Add `Session#download_byte_limit` for limiting the permitted download size.
  This can be very useful in dealing with untrusted download sources, which might attempt
  to send very large responses that would overwhelm the receiving client.
* Add `Patron.libcurl_version_exact` which returns a triplet of major, minor and patch libCURL version numbers. This can be used
  for more fine-grained matching when using some more esoteric Curl features which might not necessarily be available on libCURL
  Patron has been linked against.

### 0.8.0

* Add `Response#inspectable_body`, `Response#decoded_body`. `decoded_body` will atempt to decode
  the HTTP response into your internal encoding, using the charset header that the server has
  provided. Note that this operation may fail - if the server said that the body is in a certain
  encoding, but this is then overridden with, say, `meta` elements in the HTML Patron is _not_
  going to parse the HTML to figure out how to decode.

### 0.7.0

* Use a test server in an external process when running rspec
* Ensure responses that are not text do not force response body decoding
* Improve thread blocking region handling during requests
